    <h2>Oscar The Grouch</h2>
    <p>Oscar the grouch is a much better character due to the fact that he is literally trash. This is a relateable feature and is used for satirical humor everywhere today. Oscar the grouch is the embodiement of giving literally zero *****. He relies on his friend Big Bird to get around and I think this is commendable due to the fact that it gives big bird purpose. Oscar is also the colour green which is far superior to that of the likes of violet. Oscar may spend his time literally being trash, but if you think about it, there's nowhere down to go from there, so the only way is up. Oscar is far superior to Grimace due to the fact that he is genuine and himself, not putting on a facade like the one Grimace portrays in the advertisements, he's just trying to sell you something. Wheras Oscar is just there to be related to. </p>
